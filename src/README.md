# Pokedex

Just a program used to test and train OOP skills by creating pokemons and a pokedex.

### Consideration:
- [PokemonDriver.java](PokemonDriver.java) is only used as a test. It is not implemented.
- This was created as training for the OOP class in BCIT - CST course (COMP2522)
- Documentation was not created due to time constraints
